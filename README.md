# Almost-Amazon
This project is an exploration of ES6 modules utilizing import and export. I built a modular version of the greatest book store known to humankind - Almost Amazon. This bookstore has a single book. When you click on add to cart, the book will diaplay in a cart and will be ready to checkout.
